Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
WARNING: [Place 30-120] Sub-optimal placement for a BUFG-BUFG cascade pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	system_i/uP/processing_system7_0/inst/buffer_fclk_clk_0.FCLK_CLK_0_BUFG (BUFG.O) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y12

	system_i/BRAM1/bram_switch_0/inst/BUFGMUX_inst (BUFGCTRL.I1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y1
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two BUFGs can be used if they are placed in cyclically adjacent BUFG sites and both are in the same half (TOP/BOTTOM) side of an SLR. If this condition cannot be met, it is recommended that a BUFH be connected in series between the two BUFGs to ensure that clock region partitioning will account for the use of a clock spine for this connection.

CRITICAL WARNING: [Route 35-39] The design did not meet timing requirements. Please run report_timing_summary for detailed reports.
Resolution: Verify that the timing was met or had small violations at all previous steps (synthesis, placement, power_opt, and phys_opt). Run report_timing_summary and analyze individual timing paths.
INFO: [Route 35-253] TNS is the sum of the worst slack violation on every endpoint in the design. Review the paths with the biggest WNS violations in the timing reports and modify your constraints or your design to improve both WNS and TNS.

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP system_i/trigger_simulator_0/inst/trigger_level_k_mult0__0 output system_i/trigger_simulator_0/inst/trigger_level_k_mult0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP system_i/trigger_simulator_0/inst/trigger_level_k_mult0 multiplier stage system_i/trigger_simulator_0/inst/trigger_level_k_mult0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
